00:00.000 --> 00:02.700
Participatory Web

00:02.700 --> 00:06.300
- with wikis, comments, tags and hashtags -

00:06.300 --> 00:08.000
has transformed our hobbies.

00:08.613 --> 00:10.508
But what about work?

00:10.508 --> 00:12.810
more specifically, intellectual work,

00:12.810 --> 00:15.151
also known as "knowledge work" ?

00:15.151 --> 00:17.250
This is precisely what we are exploring

00:17.250 --> 00:21.122
through the software prototypes of the Hypertopic platform.

00:21.122 --> 00:24.500
This software platform is born

00:24.500 --> 00:28.000
from collaboration between researchers from different universities

00:28.000 --> 00:30.543
and, above all, from different disciplines.

00:30.543 --> 00:34.500
These researchers agreed on the need to take into account    

00:34.500 --> 00:38.613
in computer models for these knowledge workers,

00:38.613 --> 00:41.926
the fact that points of view may differ,

00:41.926 --> 00:45.778
the fact that not everything can be classified or counted,

00:45.778 --> 00:50.747
or that certain notions cannot be translated from one language to another.

00:50.747 --> 00:56.349
But what is common between the approach of an art historian studying a stained glass window,

00:56.349 --> 00:59.647
a sociologist investigating teachers who "drop out",

00:59.647 --> 01:02.287
students translating a Perrault fairy tale,

01:02.287 --> 01:07.426
and a committed citizen wanting to transpose ecological transition initiatives locally?

01:07.426 --> 01:11.100
They all devote time and attention

01:11.100 --> 01:13.897
to building the object they will later study.

01:13.897 --> 01:17.986
They document it so that it is admissible by others as a source.

01:17.986 --> 01:21.000
As seen in the animation on the screen,

01:21.000 --> 01:24.300
The description model must be sufficiently free

01:24.300 --> 01:27.541
to accommodate the singularity and originality of each source,

01:27.541 --> 01:29.000
but at the same time

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
must encourage a certain sedimentation of description

01:32.000 --> 01:35.458
so that these sources gradually become a corpus.

01:35.458 --> 01:40.141
Then, it is time to interpret these sources.

01:40.141 --> 01:44.000
The first form of interpretation that came to mind

01:44.000 --> 01:46.028
was categorization.

01:46.028 --> 01:50.234
As the most important thing is often the least consensual,

01:50.234 --> 01:52.845
categories belong to "viewpoints",

01:52.845 --> 01:55.973
points of view that can be those of different experts,

01:55.973 --> 01:57.800
different schools of thought

01:57.800 --> 01:59.779
or from different disciplines.

01:59.779 --> 02:04.440
Furthermore, unlike traditional knowledge management tools,

02:04.440 --> 02:07.800
categories are constructed by the actors themselves,

02:07.800 --> 02:10.100
in situation, as close as possible to the case,

02:10.100 --> 02:13.271
before being reused for other similar cases.

02:13.271 --> 02:16.742
In more general terms,

02:16.742 --> 02:24.032
whether it is a translator who wants to introduce a work to the public,

02:24.032 --> 02:27.694
to new readers across language and cultural barriers,

02:27.694 --> 02:32.040
or a sociologist who wants to report to his peers and to society at large

02:32.040 --> 02:34.193
a social fact experienced by his informants,

02:34.193 --> 02:38.746
interpretation involves determining the unit that makes sense, the fragment,

02:38.746 --> 02:40.880
interpretation involves exploring all possible meanings,

02:40.880 --> 02:45.584
and finally it involves the careful choice of words to translate without "betraying".

02:45.584 --> 02:49.792
From reformulation to reformulation, a graph is created,

02:49.792 --> 02:53.634
a hypertext as imagined by Theodor Nelson in the 60s,

02:53.634 --> 02:57.565
a way of hijacking computers,

02:57.565 --> 03:01.098
into what he called "literary machines".

03:01.098 --> 03:08.066
Interpreting sources often leads to theorizing.

03:08.066 --> 03:16.044
The sociologist, for example, articulate the different dimensions of the experience of the actors he meets,

03:16.044 --> 03:20.195
to account for situations that are attested and therefore possible.

03:41.000 --> 03:47.000
The art historian will sometimes incorporate more general knowledge

03:47.000 --> 03:49.454
from archival documents.

03:56.500 --> 03:59.400
As in the screenshot in the upper right corner,

03:59.400 --> 04:01.756
the translator, for a recurring term,

04:01.756 --> 04:05.813
given the various translations he has provided in previous contexts,

04:05.813 --> 04:09.406
is going to set out in a glossary the ones that would suit all of them.

04:09.406 --> 04:14.046
Many of these knowledge workers prefer,

04:14.046 --> 04:16.683
at first, to work without being seen.

04:16.683 --> 04:20.332
Afterwards, they will be able to invite collaborators,

04:20.332 --> 04:22.782
and disseminate their work more widely.

04:24.000 --> 04:28.561
This phase, which is essential for initiating a participatory approach,

04:28.561 --> 04:30.843
is often hampered by a lack of knowledge

04:30.843 --> 04:33.044
about personal data protection

04:33.044 --> 04:35.004
or intellectual property.

04:35.004 --> 04:37.976
On this point, for example, we experiment

04:37.976 --> 04:41.528
support in choosing "Creative Commons" licenses.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.130
The last phase, which completes the cycle

04:46.130 --> 04:49.572
between the share of an interpretation or a theory

04:49.572 --> 04:52.980
and the creation of a new interpretation by a new actor,

04:52.980 --> 04:57.500
seems to be a debate, a more informal discussion.

04:57.500 --> 05:00.687
This is why we recently experimented

05:00.687 --> 05:04.217
the reuse of ready-to-use discussion components.

05:04.217 --> 05:07.502
Initial observations suggest that,

05:07.502 --> 05:10.700
the intellectual, scientific, debate

05:10.700 --> 05:13.941
would require additional features,

05:13.941 --> 05:16.583
such as the including bibliographical references,

05:16.583 --> 05:19.786
or showing, indicating,

05:19.786 --> 05:21.379
a fragment of the source.

05:22.500 --> 05:25.500
Through these five verbs, we have seen that

05:25.500 --> 05:29.096
despite the obvious differences between the work of a sociologist,

05:29.096 --> 05:30.628
a translator, an art historian,

05:30.628 --> 05:32.231
an engaged citizen,

05:32.231 --> 05:34.641
there were analogies in method

05:34.641 --> 05:37.553
in the interpretative paths followed.

05:37.553 --> 05:41.388
Within the Hypertopic software platform

05:41.388 --> 05:43.956
we explore, for each of these steps,

05:43.956 --> 05:48.777
different uses, different ways of theorizing and instrumenting them.

05:48.777 --> 05:53.894
Gradually, it becomes possible to mutualize the corresponding software components,

05:53.894 --> 05:58.830
and, in this way, to ensure that the work of the community benefits each participant.

05:58.830 --> 06:01.441
For an even wider impact,

06:01.441 --> 06:05.327
the entire platform is published as free software.

06:05.327 --> 06:07.726
We hope to contribute

06:07.726 --> 06:09.704
to what Theodor Nelson wanted to create

06:09.704 --> 06:12.500
by inventing the notion of "hypertext"

06:12.500 --> 06:13.700
almost 60 years ago :

06:13.700 --> 06:16.241
"Literary machines",

06:16.241 --> 06:20.300
in other words: "a digital architecture for intellectual work".
